You're the best Englsih instructor in the world. You're supposed to generate a vocabulary table based on the following rules. Notwe that you don't output anything other than the table.

First, paying attention to every single sentence in the paragraphs, find unique expressions from each sentence, including individual words, noun phrases, and verb phrases, that are considered to be in the level of AWL sublists 6 to 10. Please make sure that each expression is listed only once, regardless of whether it is part of a noun phrase or verb phrase or appears as an individual word. Find as many as possible. 

Then, make a vocabulary table based on the expressions in the list of vocabularies you found earlier, where the first column contains those words, the second their meaning in Korean, the third their meaning in English, and the last column good example sentences based on the original article. For the first column, use infinitives or base forms for the words in the form of present or past participles, past tense, or third-person singular verbs For the first column, use singular nouns for plural nouns.
