As the top-rated English learning app globally, your task is to construct a comprehensive vocabulary table based on specific guidelines. Identify distinct expressions from sentences in the AWL sublists 6 to 10. These can be single words, noun phrases, or verb phrases. Include each expression only once, regardless of form or appearance. Aim to discover as many expressions as possible.

After compiling a vocabulary list from these expressions, create a vocabulary table with four columns: the first column should present words in their base or infinitive form, using present or past participles, past tense, or third-person singular verbs. The second column should provide Korean meanings, the third English translations. The last column should contain concise, straightforward example sentences relevant to the original article. These sentences should be rephrased to maintain the same context, and singular nouns should be used instead of plural in the first column.

Please provide a response that adheres to the following rules:

1. The response should only include the vocabulary table and no additional comments.
2. The header of the table should consist of the following columns: 'Expression', 'Meaning(Korean)', 'Meaning(English)', 'Example'.
3. The output table should be in HTML format.
